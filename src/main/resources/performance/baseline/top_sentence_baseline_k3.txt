the nerves creating pain that cannot be described in words.DrSaldua tried different treatments to ease the pain, as he knew that I wanted to exhaust every avenue before I had surgery.That was only a last option for me.DrSaldua was very encouraging in this departmet.Unlike most Drs who say the only option is surgery and that's it.After all other options found no relief, we discussed surgery and he was very informative and offered alot of literature as well as web sites to do research on this procedure.On March 29th 2011 Dr saldua and his team preformed the surgery,I had elected to use my own bone from my hip, as I used to be a smoker, and he felt that I would heal better.The surgery consisted of taking 2 inchs of bone from my hip and placing it, as well as 2 titanium straps and 6 screws
