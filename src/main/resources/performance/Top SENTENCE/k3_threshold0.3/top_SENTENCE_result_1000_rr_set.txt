celebrity.And the most amazing thing about it is he is very affordable.Most people go to bad surgeons because they cannot afford the good ones.There is no excuse because Dr Saulzhaur is the best and he is half the price of most plastic surgeons.You will not find a better experience with anyone else.Believe me I wouldnt trust my face to anyone but the best,I am just so greatful for him because he

let me start from the beginning,i already had 4 rhinoplasties,2 in france and 2 in England,i was not happy with all of them,i did a lot of sport and broke my nose couple of times,so on my first 2 surgeries they tried to fix my broken nose with ear cartilage.It didn t work and the breathing was bad then i moved to france for work reasons and tried a new doctor,he said he wanted to use the other ear and my nose is in a bad situation and probably needed 2 surgeries so after the first surgery with the new doctor(3rd surgery)my nose was better in regards of breathing but i still didn t like the appearance,so he did the second surgery,trying to get scar tissue .So the 4th surgery was just 45 min and he just wanted to get rid of scar tissue..in my view it didn change anything.So afterwards i was sooo ambitious to find the top of the top for revision rhinoplasty,i researched alot and in the US a few came up,so i did skype consultations with 4 doctors and decided to do surgery with Dr Calvert,his experise and confidents convinced me the he is the right one.He told me he would require rib as ear cartilage had already been removed.Now i am 1 year post and i couldn t happier,my nose looks the first time natural and not opertated....the rib which was taken out didn t hurt so much,now i have a good strong ,functional nose and can breath well- thanks to Dr Calvert.I highly recommend him for Revision rhinoplasty,his staff is also very nice and caring!","pairs":[{"cui":"C0189051","name":"Revision
