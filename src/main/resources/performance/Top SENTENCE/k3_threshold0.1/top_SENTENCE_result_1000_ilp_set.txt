me, as I was only 42 and was a contractor who has been working in the construction field for 20 yrs.I was in great health and very active in sports as well as surfed and biked.DRSaldua ran many diffrent tests as I have metal in my eye and am unable to have MRI's.He found that 2 of my cervical disks had disintigrated and was pinching the nerves as well as bone spurs which were rubbing against the nerves creating pain that cannot be described in words.DrSaldua tried different treatments to ease the pain, as he knew that I wanted to exhaust every avenue before I had surgery.That was only a last option for me.DrSaldua was very encouraging in this departmet.Unlike most Drs who say the only option is surgery and that's it.After all other options found no relief, we discussed surgery and he was very informative and offered alot of literature as well as web sites to do research on this procedure.On March 29th 2011 Dr saldua and his team preformed the surgery,I had elected to use my own bone from my hip, as I used to be a smoker, and he felt that I would heal better.The surgery consisted of taking 2 inchs of bone from my hip and placing it, as well as 2 titanium straps and 6 screws in my neck.I awoke from my surgery to find that the pain I had been dealing with was completly

ear and my nose is in a bad situation and probably needed 2 surgeries so after the first surgery with the new doctor(3rd surgery)my nose was better in regards of breathing but i still didn t like the appearance,so he did the second surgery,trying to get scar tissue .So the 4th surgery was just 45 min and he just wanted to get rid of scar tissue..in my view it didn change anything.So afterwards i was sooo ambitious to find the top of the top for revision rhinoplasty,i researched alot and in the US a few came up,so i did skype consultations with 4 doctors and decided to do surgery with Dr Calvert,his experise and confidents convinced me the he is the right one.He told me he would require rib as ear cartilage had already been removed.Now i am 1 year post and i couldn t happier,my nose looks the first time natural and not opertated....the rib which was taken out didn t hurt so much,now i have a good strong ,functional nose and can breath well- thanks to Dr Calvert.I highly recommend
