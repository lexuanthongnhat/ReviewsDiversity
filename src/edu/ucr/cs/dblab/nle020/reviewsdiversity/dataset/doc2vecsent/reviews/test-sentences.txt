i had a great experience having surgery which included a breast reduction, tummy tuck, and liposuction with dr greenwald .  
it was the first time that i had any type of surgery and i felt very comfortable with and confident in him, his office staff, and the surgery center .  
he managed to make my midsection look better than before my 4 full term pregnancies !  
i am a physician and am more than happy to refer my friends and patients to dr greenwald as i know they will be as thrilled with their results as i am with mine . 
fire this doctor as soon as possible
he used some fire like equipment and i was in horrible pain .  
a doctor who takes the time to talk to you about you  ( or anything else you wish to discuss !  )  
dr difelice is no doubt one of the best sport/med doctors that i know ;  i can prove that with my own experience, my daughter had a knee injury from sport related event, i brought her in three different places for evaluation and second opinions, i even went out of state and in the end was advised that everything was ok just put ice patch and take tylenol for pain and she should return to her sport activities, as soon as she started to run, her knee started to act up again, swollen and she was in excruciating pain .  
after many trips to other sport med doctors, my luck was to find dr difelice who immediately knew what was wrong .  
he scheduled her for a same day/surgery which was less then a week wait time, post up went great she didnt even feel her procedure, he was very instructive took his time to give us maximum information necessary before and after her procedure, the procedure went successfully, she was in discomfort for only one day, my daughter is grateful that dr difelice took care of her, she is back on track returning to her track & field spring training that she loves to do . if you need to see an orthopedic or sport med physician, dont waste your time to search for other physicians in nyc, call dr difelice to take care your problem, he is the best in this field . 
i feel and look like a completely new person and i couldn't have found a better plastic surgeon anywhere .  
doctors spend lots of time explaining & addressing needs .  
we highly recommend puri pediatric medical group to every parent ! 
dr williams is the best doctor i've ever had the pleasure of taking care of my torn up body .  
he's fixed my shoulder, taken care of both knees and is now working on my elbow .  
i recently went in for my 2nd implant surgery with dr roudner and it was just as good if not better than the first time .  
i had saline implants before because when i originally went, that was all they offered because silicone implants were taken off the market at that time .  
i was happy with the saline but wanted a fuller bigger look and i had heard many rave reviews about the new silicone implants on the market . i went in for my consultation and from that minute on, i knew i would be getting my procedure done as soon as possible .  
he did an amazing job and i still have little to no scars and its only been 2 weeks !  !  
dr wong helped us to feel confident that we would conceive from our first appointment .  
dr wong and his staff are extremely knowledgeable and always very friendly and willing to help .  
i am now pregnant thanks to dr wong and will forever be grateful to him and his staff .  
she listens to her patients, always has someone call me back, and i trust her medical advice .  
my name is kim, my grandmother took a fall in her apartment last year .  
my mother called me in a major panic and my grandmother was obviously in a lot of pain .  
the ambulance had taken her to the closet hospital which was in long island, we were told she had broken her hip and that they could schedule her for surgery asap .  
well thats where my research began and after several phones calls and emails to friends family, co- workers etc .  and online research we decided on dr greg difelice and had my grandmother transferred to lenox hill hospital .  
it was the best decision we could have ever made, my grandmothers hip healed perfectly in fact id say she is in better overall health now due to all the rehab she received and now has a more active lifestyle .  
all of her friends who have also had hip replacement surgery  ( i guess its common when you hit 80 )  complain of pain or discomfort ever since the surgery .  
he is kind, patient and had continued to check on my grandmother for months after the surgery .  
i had elective breast augmentation done by dr jacobsen, and it did not go well .  
my breasts look completely asymmetric  ( different sizes, shapes ) , and i am significantly scarred .  
i came in last august for breast surgery .  
you have given back to me something that i had only dream about, i life with a wonderful big breast .  
about 6 years ago, i made the decision to consult a doctor about my uneven breasts .  
for years i felt unattractive and lacked self confidence due to lopsided and sagging breasts .  
all i wanted at the time was to look \ " normal\ "  and this problem was starting to take over my life .  
my close friend had just had a breast reduction with amazing results and recommended that i go see dr engler .  
dr engler and his staff warmly greeted me and took their time answering all my questions .  . alot of questions .  
after dr engler thoroughly discussed all my options to me, i decided to have a lift on one side and then have medium size implants put in .  
i also had some love handles that were bothering me and decided to have liposuction to have those taken care of at the same time .  
i was worried about recovery time as well as having to be anesthetized .  
i remember calling him a couple times during odd hours when i got nervous about something, and he was right there to patiently answer my questions and concerns .  
my breasts are very natural looking and exactly what i wanted and i can finally wear the jeans i want without that undesired extra around my hips .  
i have more confidence and feel as if i don`t have to hide behind baggy sweatsuits anymore . given that dr engler did such a wonderful job 6 years ago, i recently decided to go back for another consultation over another thing that had been bothering me .  
we caught up for a few minutes and then started to discuss my new concerns .  
he addressed my options for my eyes and i then decided i was a good candidate for lower blepharoplasty .  
needless to say, having a surgery around your eyes can be quite terrifying .  
it wasn`t an easy thing for me imagine being done to myself, but again, he addressed my concerns, put me at ease and assured me that my eyes would come out wonderful . once again, this surgery was amazing !  
he followed up every day with me and continued to make sure i was healing properly .  
when i called the office to talk to him, they didn`t just rush me off the phone .  
i had one of my final consultations today and he provided me with my before an after pictures upon my request and i have to say that they are beautiful !  
he is a gifted surgeon and an amazing person that i would highly recommend to anyone considering having some work done . 
knows what she is talking about, she genuinely cares for the kids and they love her for it .  always can get an appointment whenever needed and gets back to her answering service asap .  great doctor !  
day of the surgery was full of anxiety and worries, something as major as this was too much for my psych to bear, my heart was racing .  
i can not begin to express how happy i am with my experience at la sight .  
dr wallace and his staff are phenomenal, and they truly care about patient outcome and experience .  
dr kaufman did an amazing job with my 4th and hopefully final hernia surgery .  
he had to go in and replace the fist three repairs because my body was rejecting the mesh .  
he then had to replace with biological mesh and repair a fourth hernia .  
if by chance i do need any future hernia surgeries dr kaufman will be the surgeon i choose . 
had my first appointment at victory physicians  ( dr arian )  and i will definitely return .  
i finally found my primary care physician .  
if you like the idea of turning back the clock and having a dr with a fabulous bed side manner, then you will love dr arian .  
his staff is wonderful, from the front office back to the lab .  
dr gonzales, if you can call him a doctor was terrible and slaughtered my breasts !  
i had to have a corrective surgery after my breast healed to correct his first mistakes and ended up with even worse breasts after he tried to correct them .  
i ended up with a terrible infection that they didn't know how to care for and i was taken to the hospital .  
i'm at a point now where i will never take my top off, even in front of my boyfriend ! 
thank you for taking care of me, and for giving me back my self-confidence .  
i scar badly  ( keloids ) , so when i had my consultation with dr hah we spent a great deal of time talking about my options .  
his approach from my tummy tuck incision left me scar free to the axillary area and under the breasts .  
i only have the tummy tuck incision that can be hidden under a swim suit bottom or underwear .  
i am experiencing discomfort with a producure performed and unsatisfied with results .  
there is another doctor i was going to have my procedure done but she was injuried and could not perform my surgery .  
dr savage is a very good and patient doctor but his inbred are they all one family staff should be fired .  
just saw dr bryk today for post op and he gave me the a-okay to get back to running !  !  ! 
i cannot wait to try out my  " new "  knee on the road tomorrow
she fixed my endometriosis problem that i had been dealing with for years  ( laparoscopic hyst ) , and also helped me with pms .  
she explained some hormone imbalance problems that were going on, and how that might have made the endometriosis worse, and now my pms has gotten better too . 
i`m very happy with my visit and how dr budoff went about treating my handelbow .  .  . i saw great reviews online and sure enough all the reviews were right !  
his true colors showed .  
watch out, because you will be yelled at, talked down, and treated like a child .  
the man was not even fazed when i cried because of how poorly he treated me .  
dr wallach is an incredibly talented surgeon who gave me my life back .  
i had severe cervical stenosis from rheumatoid arthritis that was affecting my ability to walk .  .  
dr wallach performed two difficult surgeries from the front and then the back of my neck .  
he also has a terrific physician's assistant . 
dr calvert is an excellent surgeon and truly cares about his patients .  
i first saw dr calvert nearly 5 years ago for a breast aug and rhinoplasty .  
from my initial consultation, to surgery and follow-ups, dr calvert and his staff were always very courteous, knowledgeable, and professional .  
i had a wonderful experience going through my surgeries with dr grigoryants .  
i chose dr ware because i wanted a woman and i couldn`t believe how lucky i was to
i no longer use dr cho as my physician .  
drdiana's sales person or consultation coordinator whatever she maybe  ( sandra )  wreaks of cigarette smoke, and is very unprofessional .  
as for drdiana, he was 45 mins late, that is to my consultation and in the end i decided not to get my surgery by drdiana and went to another surgeon .  
i was excited to finally hear of a doctor that gives you his personal phone number !  
i never received a call back .  
the reason i wanted to go to this doctor turns out to be the reason i will not go back .  
after being seen by another dermatologist in the same office, the other doctor was surprised to know that i was charged more than twice the amount usually charged for that procedure .  
even the assistants dislike her, and said that she was overcharging me .  
in addition, she burnt my face after i had laser treatment, which lead to permanent scars, and rapid regrowth of hair so i could continue more treatment with her .  
i was excited about going into an office in cleveland, ohio after being told i could improve my libido .  .  . i have tried other things and i was hoping this would be a  " cure "  for my concern .  .  . however, to my dismay, it was all about money .  .  . although the staff appeared professional, once we got started, my eyes were open and i knew this was another dead end .  .  . the cost was absolute ridiculous ;  they were deceitful and unfortunately, deceitful .  .  . you were thought to believe this would cure you naturally, but again, it was a total disappointment !  
i called to schedule an appointment and the front office told me to print out the sheets they would need from me and by doing this it would cut down the wait time for my first appointment .  
they were supposed to call me thee next day to go over insurance but never heard from them .  
called the following week but never heard from them .  
now, im just worried of getting my bill from my insurance for that 1 exam .  
also, the procedure that i was going to have done would have fallen under a cosmetic procedure but dr r and staff assured me that insurance would cover it .  
im no genius but isnt that against the law ?  
my experience is not good .  .  she calls you honey and doesnt do a full exam . 
i have the body i did before i entered into the \ " \ " real world\ " \ " , when i played sports .  
for me, after my consult, i was able to get in within 2 days !  
they finally admitted to the mistake and made the corrections .  
it will cause you nothing but regret and problems that you do not need thru your pregnancy .  
i had a simple appt to get my ear looked at ear infection .  
dr kloth is a scary man . he will yell at you if you disagree with him or don't want another shot . it is kreepy when he's nice cuz he's a jerk 90% of the time . oh, and when he is nice you can tell he has to try really hard lol .  
when i called to make an appointment for laser hair removal, i asked the office staff if the doctor could call-in a prescription for
when i arrived at the office in chinatown  ( which i live in whitestone )  and i'm currently pregnant, the staff told me that i should be here before 1pm .  
i told them at the office that i came all the way from whitestone and i'm pregnant and why the heck they didn't tell me this before i came !  !  !  
check the pawtucket times for an aug 30th article suspended finally guess he did not warn his employees that was happening when he gave them all raises .  
the person using the term fired his patients is the desk girl .  
ps real doctors work for their patients not the other way around .  
i hope i helped to save at least one life including my own as i would surely be an addict by now if i listened to the good docs advice
i was hospitalized and nearly died numerous times during those hospitalizations .  
after my last surgery, i went to see him and he gave me a letter stating that he would no longer see me as a patient .  
he offered no explanation and when i asked, he threw his credentials at me stating that johns hopkins taught him he could choose who to treat and who not to treat .  
i understand and respect that but at the same time i feel that i deserve and have earned an explanation as to why he is no longer willing to see me .  
he was unprofessional and had absolutely no regard for me or my illness or my feelings .  
i would not recommend dr batlan to anyone who is looking for a pain management doctor .  
dr mashood or dr brookshire are much better, caring doctors . 
i would swear the review written by  " yourangel "  was me .  
the receptionist is very surly- almost intimidating- and dr rosenthal talks really fast and spends no more than 5 minutes with you .  
my overall experience has not been good ,the doctor has ,no doubt,let me suffer for several months now even though test have proven that i,m in a high level of pain ( even though i'm on low doses of medications he refuses to even slightly increase my meds and i even told him no large increase low increase is certainly warrented ! 
my skin was acting up recently and i decided to come back in to see nicki .  
felt like i was rushed and left unsure of what i wished to do . went with one of other doctors in the practice and pleased with results . 
dr budoff treated me for a torn rotator cuff with a cortisone shot and 3 months of torturous physical therapy, and then wanted to do surger .  .  . 
i won't go back .  
i had to go to three doctors to get corrective surgery .  
he is forgetful and too busy .  
when describing my situation with her assistant, i found her to be rude and unapologetic .  
after seeing two other doctors, i am happy with the course of treatment dr stein has me on .  
i've waited 90plus minutes for a monitoring visit and 60plus minutes for a scheduled appointment . that said some of the pluses : -the facilities- all the tests  ( blood work, iui etc )  take place on premise-the front desk staff leave a lot to be desired but the nurses are nice .  
have seen nurse practioner more than the doc recently ;  however, am able to get into the office sooner .  
mono vision not so great . 
his staff overbooks, an hour wait in the waiting room and another 1/2 to 1 hour wait in the exam room, rushed thru a sorry excuse for a history taking, scheduled a procedure w/o explaining what and why .  
i finally dressed, went down the hall to the restroom, returned to the procedure room and undressed and gowned up again and still had to wait until he appeared .  
 ( the procedure involved introducing water or some fluid into the bladder so what value would this specimen be ?  )  
when he ordered another procedure, an outpatient procedure, no one asked what facility i preferred, nor when it was convenient for me, etc .  etc .  
dr lichen took the time and energy needed to assess and treat my chronic pain as well a breakthrough pain issues .  i have been suffering for more than  ( 3 )  years with neck  ( cervical fusion ) , and lower back  ( herniated discs l5-s1 )  chronic pain .  
additionally, i tore my  ( l )  rotator cuff due to a automobile accident last year .  
dr lichen, has been compassionate, professional, courteous, and has gone above my expectations as my pain management specialist .  
dr lichen is educated in the field and his parctice has been a god send to my health .  
dr lichen puts the patients needs in combination with the best possible treatment options to work .  
extremely content with dr lichen, medical schools need more of this dr's type coming into the field for those with chronic pain issues .  
i`ve been there for routine yearlies as well as surgeries .  
dr graven has always steered me in the right direction as far as my care has been . 
thought it was just me until i heard stories from other women .  
 " step up her game "  .  .  . i think she's got the potential . 
i have had two babies under his care .  
i believe he has a cavalier approach to obstetrics and gynecology .  
it is my observation that the care provided to patience is lacking due to the lack of time available - there are just too many other patience to de
i had the ipl photo facial to remove my brown spots age spots liver spots .  
they put goop on my face to numb it for a while, then they come in and they hit your face with like this brilliant
like all surgeries, the outcome is relative to the condition you started with .  
he has the confidence most doctors have and thinks positive ;  i found him to be very capable .  
remember that all examples of any surgeries any doctor shows you in person or online are his or her very best examples .  
i definitely agree with a bunch of the negative reviews of this doctor, but he is knowledgable and i have been pleased with my treatment .  
i usually wait another 15 minutes while i can hear the doctor in the room next to me talking endlessly about baseball and everything else not medical related .  
i over-look this because i have been pleased with his treatment of my plantar warts . 
dr klein`s practice is flourishing because of the care and professionalism that she and her staff provide .  
after the birth of my son, i had moderate acne due to hormonal fluctuations .  
always willing to help .  
and he's super understanding of my vanity- another reason i adore him .  
dr quintana turned my skin around in three months and is continuing to work with to make it the best it can be .  
once you see her you will be treated well but brace yourself for how inconsistent office staff are - from the receptionist to the b
isn`t waiting 30 - 60 minutes normal with most medical appointments i received exactly the same restylane discount noted below because apparently more was needed than anticipated .   .   .  is this a marketing gimmick to make you think you are saving hmmmm the chocolates, free facial certificate and champagne were a nice touch . 
like others i have heard him yell at patients in other rooms, this is unacceptable and very unprofessional .  
if i did that at my job i'd be fired but i guess that's one of the good things about owning your own business .  
the times i've heard him yell were years ago, he's definitely mellowed out in the last two or so years .  
it shook me up a little being treated like that but i decided to give him another chance due to me not wanting to go thru the all the hassle to find another dr i'm glad i did because he has helped me with my pain more than any other dr has .  
he will rx you just enough medication to help with your injury and not one pill more .  
i'd recommend dr kloth to someone who is willing to follow his directions to the tee and not feel the need to argue or suggest your own treatment plan .  
being in constant pain is the worst thing that has ever happened to me and dr kloth has helped, that's as honest as i can be .  
i never would have guessed how bad life could be until my accident witch put me in constant pain .  
i had one consult with dr kim a couple of months ago, and i am still considering if i should go or not go and have surgery with him .  
patients, please use multiple resources before making decisions before uingergoing surgery,
once he finally does enter the room to assess you, he will diagnose you, write prescriptions and referrals in approximately 3 minutes . cons :  he appears to have a very cold and mechanical bedside manner .  
also, i do not recommend having this doctor as the pcp for your children .  
when i asked dr boutros to refer my 4 year-old son to a pediatrician, he said there is no need to because he is healthy and doesn't have any chronic conditions .  
there was also one time when i had to wait almost an hour to see him . office space and staff :  office is cramped, hot, and looks unclean .  
dr naficy repaired my nose after several mishaps and accidents left it looking like owen wilson .  
i`ve been going back since to get
no worries at all .  .  . the staff was so kind to put me at ease and explain everything thoroughly .  
he`s not only professional and courteous, also very easy to talk to and down to earth .  
oh, and the receptionist i believe her name is tiffany was outstanding .  
the office manager lady at the front desk was absolutely
dr hedley herself is caring and thorough, though a little laid back .  
i want to second \ " pinky & the b\ " `s review .  
he is a good dermatologist, but we wouldn`t give him or his staff very high m .  .  . 
the staff was friendly and helpful and the nurses we`re
dr nayak may be a good doctor as in she knows what she is talking about and will sometimes answer your questions .  
she seems like she has split personality disorder .  
staff is fake friendly and i did not get the results i wanted .  i feel like in a couple of years i will have to have surgery again to fix everything . 
i had a breast aug last year .  
he made me feel confident again ! 
the truth is .  .  the office is small, but okay - the staff  :  the receptionist can be rude at times, she seems overwhelmed ;  the doct
the nurses line says you'll get a call back by the end of the day .  
i know doctors are busy, but i only call when i'm really concerned about something .  
the results from first blepharoplasty surgery then necklift surgery were beyond my expectations .  
i won't be back .  .  . 
||if you are okay with a long wait to get in, a short but thorough exam, then this is the dr for you . 
i will surely come back for my treatment .  
he offered many alternative therapies .  
and if he wanted you to try a supplement, you were mostly told to purchase them online .  
he was always a  " know-it-all " -- egotistical and condescending when speaking to you .  
no doubt he is intelligent, but i think he may be in some sort of personal or professional trouble because he made a serious and wicked turn around in attitude and treatment after they moved the business .  
maybe he's just tired of sick people now that he's  " well "  .  
 ( he will tell you all about how he has struggled with his own battle with fibromyalgia and cfs .  )  
you kinda stand there stunned and confused because you believe he is trying to help you, but then he will do or say something that totally speaks or says otherwise .  
he is so nonchalant with your treatment at times .  
one can really sense he could care less as long as you pay your bill .  
it does seem as though he has some sort of sexual hang-ups or something, but he has a beautiful, hard working wife ( she seems to be there alot working on something ) , so i would imagine he is getting some .  
he wants to get a patient  " hooked "  on something, so he can rip it away and watch you squirm with panic .  
i was told that a certain medication would ease my muscle aches and brainfog .  
i didn't realize all the red tape involved and took trying this therapy out lightly because he seemed too .  
didn't think the therapy was working .  
i had my hips liposuctioned by dr parker and that was great .  
then a year later i did lipo on my stomach and a breast aug .  
my stomach doesnt look very different  ( i am not heavy to begin with, i just wanted a touch up after having 2 kids .  
they were not even and when i went for a follow up 6 months later, he and his nurse/wife said how great i looked .  
needless to say, i went to dr gary breslow for an implant exchange and a lift and i am much happier already . 
i had complete previa and was treated with great care .  
teesha on the other hand is an idiot who told me i had lost my baby and should have a d&c i chose to wait a week and when i got the u/s there was a heartbeat .  
i swtiched from a midwife practice because i moved and thought i would like this office better .  
thursday is the busiest day and there is almost never a seat to sit in .  
the offices look like they need to be cleaned more often but for the most part, the office itself is clean . the staff- they are generally nice but only want to hear a little of your opinions .  
they also sometimes answer questions incorrectly . the doc and his midwife- seem nice enough .  
they are hesitant to prescribe anything at all if you need more than tylenol .  
very knowledgeable about liposuction and showed me great pictures .  the only problem was that most of the women that he showed me pictures were much smaller than me .  he suggest that i loose weight
i have never had a procedure there which did not have to be redone at another dentist's office due to failure of work .  
i have spoken with several people and they all feel the same .  
dr ackerman lives where she works so i dont understand why she wasnt there for my appointment 3 times !  !  !  
i switched doctors and it's a shame because i liked dr a but her staff is just clueless and i'm tired of waiting an hour to see the doctor for 5 min or coming there and her not being there at all .  
i wanted to discuss birth control options and found her very uninterested in having a discussion, basically interrupting me
